   * case initially before the main loop is started and also briefly whenever
   * a ZMQ message is missed and we re-initialise.  Except for these situations,
   * this state should not occur.
   *
   * PREGENESIS:  The core daemon is currently (or when the state was last
   * checked) synced to a block height below the initial state provided by
   * the GameLogic.  There is no current game state, and we wait until the
   * core daemon reaches the game's "genesis" block -- at that point, the
   * initial game state will be written as current and the state is changed
   * to OUT_OF_SYNC.
   *
   * OUT_OF_SYNC:  We have a current game state, but it is not (necessarily)
   * the current blockchain tip in the daemon.  This state occurs only briefly,
   * and is changed to CATCHING_UP when a game_sendupdates request has been
   * sent to bring the game state up to the tip.
   *
   * CATCHING_UP:  We are not at the daemon's current tip, and have requested
   * updates to be sent.  Those are processed based on a particular reqtoken
   * for now to bring us up-to-date.
   *
   * UP_TO_DATE:  As far as is known, we are at the current tip of the daemon.
   * Ordinary ZMQ notifications are processed as they come in for changes
   * to the tip, and we expect them to match the current block hash.
